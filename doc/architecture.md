# Architecture

JobTomate is built on a set of components that interact together to perform workflows:

- **Triggers** generate **events** (e.g. `Github::PullRequestOpened`, `JIRA::IssueCommentAdded`). The currently available events are webhooks and tasks (scheduled).
- **Events** trigger **actions** (e.g. `JIRAAddCommentOnGithubPullRequest`, `SlackNotifyJIRAIssueAssignee`)
- **Actions** perform effects through **commands** (e.g. `JIRA::AddComment`, `Slack::SendMessage`). This is the part where the workflow's logic is handled.

## Triggers

Any action performed by JobTomate will start from a trigger. This is were JobTomate takes inputs from the external world. The currently available triggers are:

- webhooks (e.g. Jira, Github)
- Slack bot commands

Triggers are implemented by code inside `lib/job_tomate/triggers`.

You need to implement code there only in the following cases:

- **You want to take inputs from another external service, not yet supported.** In this case, start by exploring the `triggers` directory to ensure it's not already there.
- **The existing triggers do not trigger the event(s) you need**. We'll see in the next section what are the events and how to use them.

## Events

These are the above-mentioned overall scenarios that regroup smaller Actions (see below). Example: an opened pull-request (`Event`) needs a specific comment published on Jira, an issue's status change, a bunch of potential slack notifications and a re-assignment of an issue (`Actions`).

Events, too, mostly exist, so it's very much recommended to browse through them before creating new ones.

## Actions

Smaller, more punctual scenarios that orchestrate the lowest level interactions with external services. For instance, when we need to send a slack notification about a missing bug cause (`Action`), we first need to find out who will receive it, what the text is going to be, customize the look and feel of the future message and call the generic service that will actually send the payload to Slack servers (`Command`).

This is the group most subject to modifications.
NB: by convention, we are calling `Actions` without any conditions. It is inside of them that we determine if certain `Commands` need to be executed.

## Commands

The most atomic single responsibility services that can do just one generic thing. They are the interface that communicates with all external services we use: it can be posting a Jira comment or slacking a new notification. All customisation is achieved via parameters, and unless we're introducing a completely new type of behavior (maybe sending sms or a push mobile notifications), there's no need to modify `Commands`.

## Data

Within JobTomate there're two types of data: the objects that persist in the DB (they are located at `lib/data` folder) and value objects that are only used during the execution of one particular scenario (`lib/values` folder).

### Persisted data

Some workflows rely on persisted data (e.g. users which are used to enable matching Jira accounts with Slack users, determining if a given user is a developer, a product manager...).

### Value objects

We use `Values` objects (e.g. `Github::PullRequest`, `JIRA::Changelog`) to pass data in a structured way between the triggers, actions and commands. Even if this is not enforced, value objects are intended to be immutable to limit bugs and provide helpers on raw data (e.g. `Value::JIRA#link`).

Generally this kind of data comes from external services and contains the present state of data (a Jira issue or a Github pull request or a Toggl report) at the external service. We aren't supposed to modify it, it only should be used for internal workflow. 

If you realize that external information needs to be modified, it is a valid reason to create a new action.

For example, a change of JIRA issue status requires several Slack notifications AND at the same time it triggers an external re-assignment of the issue. 

So, each Slack notification is a separate action sourced by the `Issue` value object, the change of assignee is another action that, in its turn, triggers a new webhook with the updated assignee. This change might (or might now) trigger another slack notification, but there's absolutely no need to compact all of these notifications into one service. They are completely independent.
