Automate as many things as possible in our development workflow.

## To what is it connected?

- JIRA
- Github
- Slack (and bot)

## How to use

### Start dependencies (MongoDB)

```
docker-compose up -d mongo-dev mongo-test
```

### Open a Ruby console locally

```
bin/console
```

NB: by default in non-production environments (see `RACK_ENV` environment variable), the `JIRA_DRY_RUN` is set to `"true"` to prevent JIRA API calls with effects (e.g. update, delete).

### Open a Mongo console locally

```
docker-compose run mongo-client
```

### Deploy to Heroku

```sh
# Staging
bin/set_env_staging
bin/deploy_staging

# Production
bin/set_env_production
bin/deploy_production
```

The deployed code will run a web application that will handle webhooks (see `triggers/webhooks.rb`).

Scheduled tasks must be setup for _tasks_ triggers (`triggers/tasks`). Using Heroku's Scheduler plugin, setup the following recurring task:

- `bin/run_task fetch_toggl_reports`: every 1 hour is fine

Some maintenance scripts must be scheduled too (Heroku's Scheduler plugin is fine too):

- `script/cleanup_stored_webhooks_and_requests`: every day

### Run a console on Heroku

```
heroku run bin/console -a <APP-NAME>
```

### Run a migration on Heroku

```
heroku run ruby db/migrate/... -a <APP-NAME>
```

### Dump the production database

**NB**

- This assumes you have deployed to Heroku
- You must have the `mongo` command-line client tool installed on your local machine

```
bin/dump_production_to_local
bin/dump_production_to_staging
```

### Add a new user

_In an application console:_

```
JobTomate::Data::User.create github_user: 'Github User', jira_username: 'JIRA username', developer_backend: true, developer_frontend: false, jira_reviewer: true, jira_feature_owner: false, jira_functional_reviewer: false, slack_username: 'Slack User'
```

## Setup

### Required environment variables

See `.env.example` file.

### Jira Webhook

You must setup a webhook on JIRA to trigger JIRA-related workflows. You can find this in Administration > System > Webhooks.

Here is the configuration to use:

- URL: `https://<your-domain>/webhooks/jira`
- Select "updated" issue events, on all issues (no filter)

### Github Webhook

For each repository that needs to be connected to JobTomate, setup the webhook like this:

- URL: `https://<your-domain>/webhooks/github`
- Content type: select "application/json"
- Select "Send me everything"

### Slack Webhook

Setup a webhook integration on Slack. Any default will do since they are all overriden by JobTomate. The webhook URL must be defined in the environment variables (`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`).
